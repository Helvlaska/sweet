# Sweet

Sweet is a responsive web application designed to help diabetic patients track their daily health indicators in a simple and centralized way.
The goal is to provide an educational prototype that demonstrates technical skills while addressing a real-world need.

## üìå Project Overview

Sweet allows users to:

- Record and review their blood glucose levels.
- Track additional health indicators such as weight and daily activities.
- Take notes for medical appointments.
- View a dashboard with daily, weekly, and monthly summaries.
- Explore simplified community features such as a forum and articles (for demonstration purposes).

This MVP is not a certified medical tool. It is an academic project developed as part of the Portfolio Project at Holberton School.
